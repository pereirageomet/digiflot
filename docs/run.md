# Running the Software

**Workflow**

A general workflow is as follows:
1. Make sure you have properly set up the scheme.csv, samples.csv, and the corresponding csv files for each sample, see [here](docs/configuration.md).
2. Start the software, ideally from the directory where the prepared csv files reside. For more information, see [here](docs/startTheApp.md).
3. Select the working directory in the [setup tab](docs/setup.md).
4. Select the sample and press OK in the [setup tab](docs/setup.md).
5. Move on to the [run tab](docs/run_tab.md).
6. Press start.
7. When reaching the flotation stage, start the flotation and press start once more.
8. When the measurement has finished, the software will guide you to the information tab where you may graciously give more information (see [here](docs/information_tab.md)).
9. Finally, the software guides you to the exit/restart tab. If you want to do another samples, just click restart. Otherwise exit. See also [here](docs/restart_exit.md).

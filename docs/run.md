# Running the Software

**Workflow**

A general workflow is as follows:
1. Make sure you have properly set up the scheme.csv, samples.csv, and the corresponding csv files for each sample, see [here](configuration.md).
2. Start the software, ideally from the directory where the prepared csv files reside. For more information, see [here](startTheApp.md).
3. Select the working directory in the [setup tab](setup.md).
4. Select the sample and press OK in the [setup tab](setup.md).
5. Calibrate your [camera](camera_tab.md) and [pulp chemistry sensors](calibrate_sensors_tab.md) following the guides you find on each of their hyperlinks.
6. Move on to the [run tab](run_tab.md).
7. Press start.
8. Whenever the Stage-Type defined within your scheme file ([more details here](configuration.md)), say from Conditioning to Flotation or vice-versa, the timer will be paused and you must press start again.
9. When the measurement has finished, the software will guide you to the information tab where you should give more information about product weights as well as water consumption (see [here](information_tab.md)).
10. Finally, the software guides you to the exit/restart tab. If you want to do another test, just click restart. Otherwise exit. See also [here](restart_exit.md).
11. All data recorded from the sensors and the pictures taken are to be found within a folder named as the sample you had defined. Keep in mind that DigiFlot is modular and all sensors connected will always be recorded.

# Welcome to the Lab Assistant Wiki

**Welcome**  
Welcome to the official documentation for the Lab Assistant developed as part of the DigiFloat project under the auspices of the Helmholtz Institute for Ressource Technology Freiberg! This wiki serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and contributing to the Lab Assistant Software.  

**About the Project**  
The Lab Assistant is intended to become an indespensable asset for every PhD student doing flotation experiments. The Lab Assistant provides assistance for every step of a flotation experiment, beginning with a scheme for planning the stages of the experiment, support for performing calibrations of sensors, a broad variety of interfaces for various measurement devices, a rich configurability, and commodities for tracking and storing of real-time data.  

The key features are:  
- a user-friendly graphical interface
- providing a standard for preplanning the execution of the experiments
- real-time tracking of data, i.e. probe data (pH, conductivity, ...), images, and from other devices (e.g. LIDAR, Air Flow)
- control of measurement specific parameters (e.g. air flow)
- holistic configurability: be it the number of stages, the content of each experimental stage, or the parameters of the devices - everything is configurable!
- incorporation of support features, such as sensor calibration, direct device interfaces, or interfaces to other external services
- offline and online data storage capabilites  
  
**Software Architecture of the Lab Assistant**  
The lab assistant follows architectural patterns and implements both an [Model-View-Controller architecture](docs/static.md) and [event-driven architecture](docs/dynamic.md).

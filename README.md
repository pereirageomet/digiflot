# Acknowldgements
This laboratory assistant has, so far, been developed at the [Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology](https://hzdr.de/hif), in Germany. 

The developers are extremely grateful to all test users who battled through the bugs of the preliminary versions, also providing much valuable feedback. To name a few: Borhane Ben Said, Ali Hassan, Gülce Öktem, Aliza Salces, and Klaus Sygusch.

Also many thanks to Rocco Naumann, responsible to assure the safety of all of our sensors, always engineering the best connectors for the laboratory assistant.

This project has been partially financed by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space through the WIR! Recomine funding scheme, project "WIR!-rECOmine – Digitalisierung und modellprädiktive Regelung komplexer Aufbreitungsprozesse mittels Sensorfusion und KI-gestützter Auswertung (03WIR1919B)".
